title: "Adjusting Treatment Effect Estimates for Patient Crossover"
subtitle: "A Review of Existing Methods"
excerpt: "This presentation was part of an information session and workshop for Oncology statisticians. I review  methods to adjust estimates of treatment effect when clinical trial patients can *crossover* from the standard-of-care arm to the treatment arm. I provide references so readers can review topic relevant to them at a later time."
